Babesiosis is transmitted by the bite of an infected blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, the same tick that transmits Lyme disease and anaplasmosis.&nbsp; Most patients acquire this disease while traveling to endemic areas outside NYC. However, there has been an increase in the number of cases with no history of travel to endemic areas, primarily in Staten Island, as well as isolated cases in the Bronx and Queens. Babesiosis can also be transmitted through transfused blood products.</p>",
